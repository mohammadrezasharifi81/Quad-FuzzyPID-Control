# Simulation of a Robust Fuzzy-PID Controller for Quadcopter Position and Attitude
In this project, a robust Fuzzy-PID controller for a 6-DOF quadcopter was designed and simulated in MATLAB & Simulink to overcome the limitations of standard PID controllers, such as instability, poor tracking, and sensitivity to uncertainties. The resulting intelligent controller demonstrated superior performance by eliminating overshoot and oscillations and significantly improving trajectory accuracy. The success of the design was quantitatively validated using MSE and ITAE performance metrics.
